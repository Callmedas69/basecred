# Core Principles

BaseCred is opinionated by constraint.

- **No aggregation** – facets remain independent and parallel
- **No judgment** – expose signals without verdicts
- **No ranking** – no user comparisons or leaderboards
- **Explicit absence** – missing data is never hidden
- **Time over snapshots** – continuity matters more than scores
