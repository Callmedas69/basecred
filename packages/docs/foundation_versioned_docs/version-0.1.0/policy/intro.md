# Policy

Foundation policies govern how BaseCred defines and implements behaviour across components. Policies are normative: implementations (including the Decision Engine) must align to them.

:::info
More policies may be added here over time. Each policy is a separate sub-page under Policy.

## Policies

- **[Context and Decision Scenarios](./context-and-decision-scenarios)** — Defines decision contexts (scenarios) and the parameters used to measure each. Context definitions must exist before any rules are written or changed.
