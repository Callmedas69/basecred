# OpenClaw Integration

Give your OpenClaw agent the ability to check any human's on-chain and social reputation before granting access.

## Overview

BaseCred provides an **OpenClaw Skill** that teaches agents to:
- Identify humans by wallet address or Farcaster FID
- Call the BaseCred API to evaluate reputation
- Interpret ALLOW / DENY / ALLOW\_WITH\_LIMITS decisions
- Handle errors gracefully (never default to ALLOW)

## Setup

### 1. Get an API Key

1. Visit [basecred.xyz/agent](https://basecred.xyz/agent)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Sign a message to authenticate
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key — it's only shown once

### 2. Install the Skill

**Option A: OpenClaw CLI**

```bash
npx @basecred/openclaw-skill
```

**Option B: Manual**

```bash
curl -s https://basecred.xyz/skill.md > ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/basecred-reputation/SKILL.md
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Set these environment variables in your OpenClaw config:

```
BASECRED_API_URL=https://basecred.xyz
BASECRED_API_KEY=bc_your_api_key_here
```

## API Reference

### POST /api/v1/decide

Check a human's reputation.

**Headers:**

| Header | Value |

| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |

**Body:**

```json
{
  "subject": "0x1234...abcd",
  "context": "allowlist.general"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "decision": "ALLOW",

  "signals": {

    "creator": "MODERATE",
    "spamRisk": "NEUTRAL",

}
```

## Available Contexts

| Context | Use Case |
|---|---|
| `allowlist.general` | General access or allowlist checks |
| `comment` | Comment or message permission |
| `publish` | Content publishing rights |
| `apply` | Application or submission gating |
| `governance.vote` | Governance participation |

## Decision Values

| Decision | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ALLOW` | Good reputation — proceed |
| `ALLOW_WITH_LIMITS` | Mixed signals — proceed with restrictions |
| `DENY` | Insufficient reputation — block action |

## Error Handling

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `401` | Invalid API key | Check configuration |
| `429` | Rate limited (100 req/min) | Wait for `Retry-After` |
| `5xx` | Server error | **Never default to ALLOW** — retry later |

## Rate Limits

- **100 requests per minute** per API key
- Rate limit resets on a sliding window
- `429` responses include a `Retry-After` header

## Security

- API keys are hashed (SHA-256) before storage
- All key management requires wallet signature verification
- Activity logs let key owners see who's checking their reputation
- Keys can be revoked instantly from the dashboard
