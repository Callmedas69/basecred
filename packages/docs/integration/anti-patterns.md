# Anti-Patterns

> What NOT to do with BaseCred.

:::danger Don't create a leaderboard
BaseCred decisions are categorical (Allow/Deny), not scalar. Ranking users implies false precision.
:::

:::danger Don't use as "Credit Score"
Financial creditworthiness is NOT evaluated by BaseCred. Using it for undercollateralized lending is dangerous.
